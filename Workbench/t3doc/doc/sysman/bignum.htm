<h1>BigNumber</h1>

<p>The T3 VM's basic numeric type is the integer type.  While this is
largely adequate for writing interactive fiction, it's sometimes useful
to have access to floating-point and high-precision integer arithmetic.
The BigNumber type provides this functionality.

<p>BigNumber can represent values with enormous precision, storing up
to 65,000 decimal digits in a value; and can represent a huge range of
values, with absolute values up to 10<sup>32767</sup> and down to
10<sup>-32767</sup>.  These limits are so extreme that real-world
calculations should practically never bump up against them.
Furthermore, the BigNumber type can store values with whatever
precision is actually required for each particular value, up to the
limits; a program can use this flexibility to strike the balance it
requires between numerical precision and performance.

<p>For reasons that are probably obvious, the more precision a
BigNumber value stores, the more memory it uses and the more time it
takes to perform calculations with the number.  BigNumber lets the
programmer determine how much precision to use, so that the programmer
can balance the degree of numerical precision against the cost in
performance.

<p>Note that the BigNumber type is not the "double" or IEEE floating
point type that readers might have encountered in other programming
languages.  The BigNumber type is actually a custom type implemented
entirely in the T3 VM.  This has several advantages over "doubles":

<ul>

<li>BigNumber is portable to any computer, and behaves exactly the
same way on every computer.  Doubles tend to have subtle but sometimes
vexing variations from one computer to another.

<li>BigNumber uses a decimal rather than binary encoding, which means
that any value that can be written in a decimal format can be
represented exactly without rounding error.  In contrast, some values
that can be represented exactly in decimal <i>can't</i> be represented
exactly in a binary encoding.  For example, 1/5 is an endlessly
repeating bit pattern in binary, much as 1/3 is an endless sequence in
decimal (0.333333...); this surprises many people, because 1/5 is such
a nice, round value - 0.2 - in decimal.  This mismatch between what
can be represented exactly in the two numbering systems can lead to
the accumulation of unexpected rounding errors - unexpected because
the intermediate values all look nice and exact when written in
decimal.  Using a decimal encoding, as BigNumber does, eliminates this
potential confusion.

<li>BigNumber allows for effectively unlimited precision.  Doubles
have a fixed - and relatively small - precision.  The nearly unlimited
precision of BigNumber allows calculations involving very large
integers, for example, or precise calculations where very large and
very small values are combined.

</ul>

<p>(We shouldn't make it sound like BigNumber is better in every
respect; doubles do have some advantages of their own, the foremost
being better performance.  This is partly because the algorithms for
doing arithmetic are simpler for a fixed-precision type than for a
varying-precision type, but the bigger reason is that doubles are
implemented in hardware on many platforms.  The performance trade-offs
we have to make for BigNumber seem reasonable, though, given the type
of application TADS is designed for.  And it's rather neat to be able
to calculate <i>pi</i> to a thousand digits with a couple of lines of
code.)

<h2>Working with BigNumber values</h2>

<p>You must <span class="code">#include &lt;bignum.h&gt;</span> in your source files to use the
BigNumber class.  This file defines the BigNumber class interface.

<p>You can write a BigNumber value as a floating-point constant.
This is a numeric constant that contains a decimal point or
an exponent, or both.  Syntactically, that means one of these formats:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synMark>(</span> <span class=synLit>E</span> <span class=synMark>|</span> <span class=synLit>e</span> <span class=synMark>)</span>  <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synLit>+</span> <span class=synMark>|</span> <span class=synLit>-</span> <span class=synMark>]</span>  <span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span>
<span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synMark>]</span>  <span class=synLit>.</span> <span class=synMark>(</span> <span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synMark>)</span>  <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synMark>(</span> <span class=synLit>E</span> <span class=synMark>|</span> <span class=synLit>e</span> <span class=synMark>)</span>  <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synLit>+</span> <span class=synMark>|</span> <span class=synLit>-</span> <span class=synMark>]</span>  <span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span>
<span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synLit>.</span> <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synMark>(</span> <span class=synLit>E</span> <span class=synMark>|</span> <span class=synLit>e</span> <span class=synMark>)</span>  <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synLit>+</span> <span class=synMark>|</span> <span class=synLit>-</span> <span class=synMark>]</span>  <span class=synPar>digit</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synMark>]</span> 
</pre></div>

<p>For example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = 3.14159265;
</pre></div>

<p>This syntax actually creates a BigNumber object that represents
the given number.  The compiler assigns the BigNumber's precision
based on the number of significant digits in the constant value:
this is the number of digits, ignoring leading zeros.  For
example, <span class="code">0.00001</span> has only one digit of precision, since the
leading zeroes are ignored, whereas <span class="code">0.00001000</span> has a precision
of four digits, since trailing zeroes are significant.  The
one exception to the leading-zero rule is that if the value is
actually zero, <i>all</i> of the zeroes in the constant are
significant: so <span class="code">0.0000000</span> has a precision of 8 digits.

<p>You can also use the <span class="code">new</span> operator to create a BigNumber.  Pass
the value for the number either as an integer or as a character
string.  You can optionally specify the precision to use for the
value; if you don't specify a precision, the system infers a precision
from the value.  If the source value is a string, the implied
precision is the number of significant digits, the same as for a
constant BigNumber value; if the source is an integer, the default
precision is 32 digits.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new BigNumber(100);
x = new BigNumber(100, 10); // set precision to 10 digits
y = new BigNumber('3.14159265');
z = new BigNumber('1.06e-30');
z = new BigNumber('1.06e-30', 8); // precision is 8 digits
</pre></div>

<p>If you specify a string value, you can use a decimal point, and you
can also use an 'E' to specify a base-ten exponent.  So, the fourth
value above should be read as 1.06&times;10<sup>-30</sup>.

<p>Using the <span class="code">new</span> operator has the advantage that you can
explicitly specify the precision you want for the new value.  If you
do, it overrides the default precision that would otherwise be
inferred from the source value.

<p>You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
and negation on BigNumber values using the standard operators.  You
can also use integer values with BigNumber values in calculations,
although the BigNumber value must always be the first operand in an
expression involving both a BigNumber and an integer.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = y + z;
x = (y + z) * (y - z) / 2;
</pre></div>

<p>Similarly, you can compare BigNumber values using the normal
comparison operators:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
if (x &gt; y)
  // ... 
</pre></div>

<p>You can convert a BigNumber to a string using the <span class="code">toString()</span>
function in the tads-gen intrinsic function set.  <span class="code">toString()</span> uses
a default formatting, though, so if you want control over the
format, you should use the <span class="code">formatString()</span> method of the BigNumber
object itself.

<p>You can convert a BigNumber to a regular integer value using the
<span class="code">toInteger()</span> function from the tads-gen function set.  Note that
<span class="code">toInteger()</span> throws an error if passed a <span class="code">BigNumber</span> value that's
too large to represent as a 32-bit integer.  The integer type can only
store values from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.  <span class="code">toInteger()</span>
rounds numbers with fractional parts to the nearest integer.

<p>You can't use operators other than those listed above with
BigNumber values.  You can't use a BigNumber as an operand for any of
the bitwise operators (<span class="code">&amp;</span>, <span class="code">|</span>, <span class="code">~</span>).  You also can't use a
BigNumber with the integer modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>), but you can obtain
similar functionality from the <span class="code">divideBy()</span> method.

<p>You can't use BigNumber values in function and method calls that
require integer arguments.  You must explicitly convert a BigNumber
value to an integer with the <span class="code">toInteger()</span> function if you want to pass
it to a method or function that takes an integer value; the compiler
does not perform these conversions for you automatically.

<p>Because BigNumber values are, for most purposes, simply object
references, you can use them where you can use other objects; you can,
for example, store a BigNumber in a list, or assign it to an object
property.

<p>Note that the compiler doesn't perform constant folding on
expressions involving BigNumbers values.  This means that an
expression like the following will result in a run-time calculation
being performed every time it's evaluated:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define PI 3.14159265
x = PI/4;
</pre></div>

<h2>Calling methods on BigNumber values</h2>

<p>The BigNumber class provides a number of methods for manipulating
values.  Note that all of the methods that perform calculations return
new BigNumber values.  A BigNumber object's value is immutable once
the object is created, so all calculations performed on these objects
return new objects representing the result values.

<p>These functions are all methods called on a BigNumber object.  For
example, to calculate the absolute value of a BigNumber value <span class="code">x</span>, we
would code this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
y = x.getAbs();
</pre></div>

<p>Some of the methods take an argument giving a value to be combined
with the target number.  For example, to get the remainder of dividing
10 by 3, we'd write this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new BigNumber('10.0000');
y = new BigNumber('3.00000');
rem = x.divideBy(y)[2];  // second list item is remainder
</pre></div>

<h2>BigNumber methods</h2>

<p><span class="code">arccosine()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the arccosine (the number whose cosine is this value), as a
value in radians, of the number.  This function is mathematically
meaningful only for input values from -1 to +1; this function throws a
run-time exception if the input value is outside of this range.

</div>

<p><span class="code">arcsine()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the arcsine (the number whose sine is this value), as a value
in radians, of the number.  This function is mathematically meaningful
only for input values from -1 to +1; this function throws a run-time
exception if the input value is outside of this range.

</div>

<p><span class="code">arctangent()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the arctangent (the number whose tangent is this value), as a
value in radians, of the number.

</div>

<p><span class="code">copySignFrom(<i>x</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a number containing the same absolute value as this number,
but with the sign of x replacing the original value's sign.

</div>

<p><span class="code">cosh()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the hyperbolic cosine of the number and returns the result.

</div>

<p><span class="code">cosine()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the trigonometric cosine of the number (interpreted as a
radian value) and returns the result.  Refer to the description of
sine() for notes on how the input precision affects the calculation.

</div>

<p><span class="code">degreesToRadians()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Converts the value from radians to degrees and returns the number of
degrees.  This simply multiplies the value by (<i>pi</i>/180).
 
</div>

<p><span class="code">divideBy(<i>x</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the integer quotient of dividing this number by x, and
returns a list with two elements.  The first element is a BigNumber
value giving the integer quotient, and the second element is a
BigNumber value giving the remainder of the division, which is a
number <i>remainder</i> satisfying the relationship <i>dividend</i>
<span class="code">=</span> <i>quotient</i><span class="code">*</span><i>divisor</i> <span class="code">+</span> <i>remainder</i>.

<p>Note that the quotient returned from <span class="code">divideBy()</span> is not
necessarily equal to the whole part of the result of the division
(<span class="code">/</span>) operator applied to the same values.  If the precision of the
result (which is, as with all calculations, equal to the larger of the
precisions of the operands) is insufficient to represent exactly the
integer quotient result, the quotient returned from this function will
be rounded differently from the quotient returned by the division
operator.  The division operator always rounds its result to the
nearest integer; in contrast, <span class="code">divideBy</span> does <b>not</b> round the
quotient, but instead truncates any trailing digits beyond the
result's precision.  The reason for this difference is that the
truncation ensures that the relationship (dividend = quotient*divisor
+ remainder) always holds for <span class="code">divideBy</span> results, which would not
always be the case if the quotient were rounded.

<p>Also, the remainder will not necessarily be less than the divisor.
If the quotient can't be represented exactly (this occurs if the
precision of the quotient is smaller than its scale), the remainder
will be the correct value so that the relationship (dividend =
quotient*divisor + remainder) holds, rather than the unique remainder
that's smaller than the divisor.  In all cases where the result
precision is sufficient to represent the exact integer quotient, the
remainder will satisfy this relationship <b>and</b> will be the unique
remainder with absolute values less than the divisor.

</div>

<p><span class="code">equalRound(<i>num</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Determine if this value is equal to num after rounding.  This is
equivalent to the <span class="code">==</span> operator if the numbers have the same
precision, but if one number is more precise than the other, this
rounds the more precise of the two values to the precision of the less
precise value, then compares the values.  The <span class="code">==</span> operator makes an
exact comparison, effectively extending the precision of the less
precise value by adding imaginary zeroes to the end of the number.

</div>

<p><span class="code">expE()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the result of raising <i>e</i>, the base of the natural
logarithm, to the power of this number.

</div>

<p><span class="code">formatString(<i>maxDigits</i>, <i>flags</i>?, <i>wholePlaces</i>?, <i>fracDigits</i>?, <i>expDigits</i>?, <i>leadFiller</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Formats the number, returning a string with the result.  All of the
arguments after <i>maxDigits</i> are optional.

<p><i>maxDigits</i> specifies the maximum number of digits to display in the
formatted number; this is an upper bound only, and doesn't force a
minimum number of digits.  If necessary, the function uses scientific
notation to make the number fit in the requested number of digits.

<p><i>wholePlaces</i> specifies the minimum number of places to show
before the decimal point; if the number doesn't fill all of the
requested places, the function inserts leading spaces (before the sign
character, if any).  

<p><i>fracDigits</i> specifies the number of digits to display after
the decimal point.  This specifies the maximum to display, and also
the minimum; if the number doesn't have enough digits to display, the
method adds trailing zeroes, and if there are more digits than
<i>fracDigits</i> allows, the method rounds the value for display.  

<p><i>expDigits</i> is the number of digits to display in the exponent;
leading zeroes are inserted if necessary to fill the requested number
of places.

<p>Each of <i>wholePlaces</i>, <i>fracDigits</i>, and <i>expDigits</i>
can be specified as -1, which tells the method to use the default
value, which is simply the number of digits actually needed for the
respective parts.
 
<p><i>leadFiller</i>, if specified, gives a string that is used
instead of spaces to fill the beginning of the string, if required to
satisfy the <i>wholePlaces</i> argument.  This argument is ignored if
its value is <span class="code">nil</span>.  If a string value is provided for this
argument, the characters of the string are inserted, one at a time, to
fill out the <i>wholePlaces</i> requirement; if the end of the string
is reached before the full set of padding characters is inserted, the
function starts over again at the beginning of the string.  For
example, to insert alternating asterisks and pound signs, you would
specify <span class="code">'*#'</span> for this argument.

<p><i>flags</i> is a combination of the following bit-flag values
(combined with the bit-wise OR operator, <span class="code">|</span>):

<ul>

<li><span class="code">BignumSign</span> - always show a sign character.  Normally, if the
number is positive, the function omits the sign character.  If this
flag is specified, a <span class="code">+</span> sign is shown for a positive number.

<li><span class="code">BignumPosSpace</span> - if the number is positive and this flag is set,
the function inserts a leading space.  (If <span class="code">BignumSign</span> is specified,
this flag is ignored.)  This function can be used to ensure that
positive and negative numbers fill the same number of character
positions, even when you don't want to use a <span class="code">+</span> sign with positive
numbers.

<li><span class="code">BignumExp</span> - always show the number in exponential format
(scientific notation).  If this is not included, the function shows
the number without an exponent if it will fit in <i>maxDigits</i> digits.

<li><span class="code">BignumExpSign</span> - always show a sign in the exponent.  If this is
included, a positive exponent will be shown with a <span class="code">+</span> sign.  This
flag is ignored unless an exponent is displayed (so specifying this
flag doesn't force an exponent to be displayed).

<li><span class="code">BignumLeadingZero</span> - always show a zero before the decimal point.
This is only important when the number's absolute value is between 0
and 1, and an exponent isn't displayed; without this flag, no digits
will precede the decimal point for such values (so 0.25 would be
formatted as simply <span class="code">'.25'</span>).

<li><span class="code">BignumPoint</span> - always show a decimal point.  If the number has no
fractional digits to display, and this flag is included, a trailing
decimal point is displayed.  Without this flag, no decimal point is
displayed if no digits are displayed after the decimal point.

<li><span class="code">BignumCommas</span> - show commas to set off thousands, millions,
billions, and so on.  This flag has no effect if the number is shown
in scientific notation.  Commas don't count against the
<i>maxDigits</i> or <i>wholePlaces</i> limits.  However, commas do
count for leading filler, which ensures that a column of numbers
formatted with filler and commas will line up properly.

<li><span class="code">BignumEuroStyle</span> - use European-style formatting: use periods
instead of commas to set off thousands, millions, etc., and use a
comma instead of a period to indicate the decimal point.

</ul>

</div>

<p><span class="code">getAbs()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a number containing the absolute value of this number.  (This
function could be easily coded from a comparison and negation, but the
method implementation is more efficient.)

</div>

<p><span class="code">getCeil()</span>
<div class=fdef>

"Ceiling": returns a number containing the least integer greater than
this number.  For example, the ceiling of 2.2 is 3.  Note that for
negative numbers, the least integer above a number has a smaller
absolute value, so the ceiling of -1.6 is -1.

</div>

<p><span class="code">getE(<i>digits</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the value of <i>e</i> (the base of the natural logarithm,
approximately 2.781828183) to the given number of digits of precision.
This is a static method, so you can call this method directly on the
BigNumber class itself:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = BigNumber.getE(10);
</pre></div>

<p>The BigNumber class internally caches the value of <i>e</i> to the
highest precision calculated so far during the program's execution, so
this routine only needs to compute the value when it is called with a
higher precision than that of the previously cached value.

</div>

<p><span class="code">getFloor()</span>
<div class=fdef>

"Floor": returns a number containing the greatest integer less than
this number.

</div>

<p><span class="code">getFraction()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a number containing only the fractional part of this number
(the digits after the decimal point). 

</div>

<p><span class="code">getPi(<i>digits</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the value of <i>pi</i> (<i>pi</i>, the mathematical constant
defined as the ratio of a circle's circumfrence to its diameter,
approximately 3.14159265) to the given number of digits of precision.
This is a static method, so you can call this method directly on the
BigNumber class itself:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = BigNumber.getPi(10);
</pre></div>

<p>The BigNumber class internally caches the value of <i>pi</i> to the
highest precision calculated so far during the program's execution, so
this routine only needs to compute the value when it is called with a
higher precision than that of the cached value.

</div>

<p><span class="code">getPrecision()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the number of digits of precision that this number stores.
The return value is of type integer.

</div>

<p><span class="code">getScale()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a value of type integer giving the base-10 scale of this
number.  If the return value is positive, it indicates the number of
digits before the decimal point in the decimal representation of the
number.  If the return value is zero, it indicates that the number has
no whole part, and that the first digit after the decimal point is
non-zero (so the number is greater than or equal to 0.1, and less than
1.0).  If the return value is negative, it indicates that the number
has no whole part, and gives the number of digits of zeroes that
immediately follow the decimal point before the first non-zero digit.
If the value of the number is exactly zero, the return value is 1.

</div>

<p><span class="code">getWhole()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a number containing only the whole part of this number (the
digits before the decimal point).

</div>

<p><span class="code">isNegative()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns true if the number is less than zero, nil if the number is
greater than or equal to zero.

</div>

<p><span class="code">log10()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the base-10 logarithm of the number.

</div>

<p><span class="code">logE()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the natural logarithm of the number.  The logarithm of a
non-positive number is not a real number, so this function throws a
run-time exception if the number is less than or equal to zero.

</div>

<p><span class="code">negate()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a number containing the arithmetic negative of this number.

</div>

<p><span class="code">radiansToDegrees()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Converts the value from degrees to radians and returns the number of
radians.  This simply multiplies the value by (180/<i>pi</i>).

</div>

<p><span class="code">raiseToPower(<i>y</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the value of this number raised to the power <i>y</i> and
returns the result.  If the value of the target number is negative,
then <i>y</i> must be an integer: if <i>x</i> &lt; 0, we can rewrite
<i>x</i><sup><i>y</i></sup> as
(-1)<sup><i>y</i></sup>(-<i>x</i>)<sup><i>y</i></sup>, and we know
that <span class="code">-</span><i>x</i> &gt; 0 because <i>x</i> &lt; 0.  The result of
raising -1 to a non-integer exponent cannot be represented as a real
number, hence this function throws an error if the target number is
negative.  Note also that raising zero to any positive exponent yields
0, and raising any value to the power 0 yields 1.  Raising 0 to an
exponent of 0 is undefined; 0 raised to any negative exponent is
equivalent to the inverse of 0 to the absolute value of the exponent,
which is the same as 1/0, which throws a divide-by-zero exception.

</div>

<p><span class="code">roundToDecimal(<i>places</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a number rounded to the given number of digits after the
decimal point.  The new number has the same precision as this number,
but all of the digits after the given number of places after the
decimal point will be set to zero, and the last surviving digit will
be rounded.  If <i>places</i> is zero, this simply rounds the number
to an integer.  If <i>places</i> is less than zero, this rounds the
number to a power of ten: <span class="code">roundToDecimal(-1)</span> rounds to the nearest
multiple of ten, <span class="code">roundToDecimal(-2)</span> rounds to the nearest multiple
of 100, and so on.  Note that the precision of the result is the same
as the precision of the original value; rounding merely affects the
value, not the stored precision.

</div>

<p><span class="code">scaleTen(<i>x</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new number containing the value of this number scaled by
10<sup><i>x</i></sup>.  If <i>x</i> is positive, this multiplies this
number's value by ten <i>x</i> times (so if <i>x</i> = 3, the result
is this number's value times 1000).  If <i>x</i> is negative, this
divides this number's value by ten <i>x</i> times.  (This is more
efficient than explicitly multiplying by ten, because it simply
adjusts the number's internal scale factor.)

</div>

<p><span class="code">setPrecision(<i>digits</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new number with the same value as this number but with the
specified number of digits of precision.  If <i>digits</i> is higher
than this number's precision, the new value is simply extended with
zeroes in the added trailing digits.  If <i>digits</i> is lower than
this number's precision, the value is rounded to the given number of
digits of precision.

</div>

<p><span class="code">sine()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the trigonometric sine of the number (interpreted as a radian
value) and returns the result.

<p>Note that the input value must be expressed in radians.  If you are
working in degrees, you can convert to radians by multiplying your
degree values by (<i>pi</i>/180), since 180 degress equals <i>pi</i> radians.
For convenience, you can use the <span class="code">degreesToRadians()</span> function to
perform this conversion.

<p>Note also that this remainder calculation's precision is limited by
the precision of the original number itself, so a very large number
with insufficient precision to represent at least a few digits after
the decimal point (1.234e27, for example) will encounter a possibly
significant amount of rounding error, which will affect the accuracy
of the result.  This should almost never be a problem in practice,
because there is usually little reason to compute angle values outside
of plus or minus a few times pi, but users should keep this in mind if
they are using very large numbers and the trigonometric functions
yield unexpected or inaccurate results.

</div>

<p><span class="code">sinh()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the hyperbolic sine of the number and returns the result.

</div>

<p><span class="code">sqrt()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the square root of the number.  If the number is negative,
this function throws a run-time exception.

</div>

<p><span class="code">tangent()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the trigonometric tangent of the number (interpreted as a
radian value) and returns the result.  Refer to the description of
sine() for notes on how the input precision affects the calculation.

<p>Note that the tangent of (2<i>n</i>+1)*<i>pi</i>/2, where <i>n</i> is
any integer, (i.e., any odd multiple of <i>pi</i>/2) is undefined, and that
the limit approaching these values is plus or minus infinity.  The
BigNumber class internally calculates the tangent as the sine divided
by the cosine, and as a result it is possible to generate a
divide-by-zero exception by evaluating the tangent at one of these
values.  However, in most cases, because the input value cannot be
exactly an odd multiple of <i>pi</i>/2 (because it isn't even theoretically
possible to represent <i>pi</i> exactly with a finite number of decimal
digits), the tangent will return a number with a very large absolute
value.

</div>

<p><span class="code">tanh()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Computes the hyperbolic tangent of the number and returns the result.

<h2>Precision and Scale</h2>

<p>Each floating-point value that BigNumber represents has two
important attributes apart from its value: precision and scale.  For
the most part, these are internal attributes that you can ignore;
however, in certain cases, it's useful to know how BigNumber uses
these internally.

<p>The scale of a BigNumber value is a multiplier that determines how
large the number really is.  A BigNumber value stores a scale so that
a very large or very small number can be represented compactly,
without storing all of the digits that would be necessary to write out
the number in decimal format.  This is the same idea as writing a
number in scientific notation, which represents a number as a value
between 1 and 10 multiplied by ten raised to a power; for example, we
could write four hundred fifty billion as 450,000,000,000, or more
compactly in scientific notation as 4.5e11 (the "e" means "times ten
to the power of the number that follows", so this means "4.5 times
10<sup>11</sup>"; note that 10<sup>11</sup> is one hundred billion).
When we write a number in scientific notation, we need only write the
significant digits, and can elide the trailing zeroes of a very large
number.  We can also use scientific notation to write numbers with
very small absolute values, by using a negative exponent: 9.7e-9 is
9.7 times 10<sup>-9</sup>; 10<sup>-9 </sup> is 1/10<sup>9</sup>, or one
one-billionth.

<p>The precision of a BigNumber value is simply the number of decimal
digits that the value actually stores.  A number's precision
determines how many distinct values it can have; the higher the
precision, the more values it can store, and hence the finer the
distinctions it can make between adjacent representable values.  The
precision is independent of the scale; if you create a BigNumber value
with only one digit of precision, it's not limited to representing the
values -9 through +9, because the scale can allow it take on larger or
smaller values.  So, you can represent arbitrarily large values
regardless of a number's precision; however, the precision limits the
number of distinct values the number can represent, so, for example,
with one digit of precision, the next representable value after 8000
is 9000.
 
<p>When you create a BigNumber value, you can explicitly assign it a
precision by passing a precision specifier to the constructor.  If you
don't specify a precision, BigNumber will use a default precision.  If
you create a BigNumber value from an integer, the default precision is
32 digits.  If you create a BigNumber value from a string, the
precision is exactly enough to store the value's significant digits.
A significant digit is a non-zero digit, or a zero that follows a
non-zero digit.  Here are some examples:

<ul>

<li><span class="code">'0012'</span> has two significant digits (the leading zeroes are
ignored).

<li><span class="code">'1.2000'</span> has five significant digits (the trailing zeroes are
significant because they follow non-zero digits).

<li><span class="code">'.00012'</span> has two significant digits (the leading zeroes are
ignored, even though they follow the decimal point).

<li><span class="code">'000.00012'</span> has two significant digits (leading zeroes are
ignored, whether they appear before or after the decimal point).

<li><span class="code">'1.00012'</span> has six significant digits (the zeroes after the decimal
point are significant because they follow a non-zero digit).

<li><span class="code">'3.20e06'</span> has three significant digits (the digits of the
exponent, if specified, are not relevant to the number's precision).

</ul>


<p>When you use BigNumber values in calculations, the result is almost
every case has the same precision as the value operated upon; in the
case of calculations involving two or more operands, the result has
precision equal to the greatest of the precisions of the operands.
For example, if you add a number with three digits of precision to a
number with eight digits of precision, the result will have eight
digits of precision.  This has the desirable effect of preserving the
precision of your values in arithmetic, so that the precision you
choose for your input data values is carried forward throughout your
calculations.  For example, consider this calculation:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new BigNumber('3.1415');
y = new BigNumber('0.000111');
z = x + y;
</pre></div>

<p>The exact arithmetic value of this calculation would be 3.1416111,
but this is not the value that ends up in z, because the precision of
the operands limits the precision of the result.  The precision of x
is 5, because it is created from a string with five significant
digits.  The precision of y is 3.  The result of the addition will
have a precision of 5, because that is the larger of the two input
precisions.  So, the result value stored in z will be 3.1416 - the
additional two digits of y are dropped, because they cannot be
represented in the result value's 5 digits of precision.

<p>Precision limitations are fairly intuitive when the precision lost
is after the decimal point, but note that digits can also be dropped
before a decimal point.  Consider this calculation:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new BigNumber('7.25e3');
y = new BigNumber('122');
z = x + y;
</pre></div>

<p>The value of x is 7.25e3, or 7250; this value has three digits of
precision.  The value of y also has three digits of precision.  The
exact result of the calculation is 7372, but the value stored in z
will be 7370: the last digit of y is dropped because the result
doesn't have enough precision to represent it.

<p>Note that calculations will in most cases round their result values
when they must drop precision from operand values.  For example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new BigNumber('7.25e3');
y = new BigNumber('127');
z = x + y;
</pre></div>

<p>The exact result would be 7377, but the value stored in z will be
7380: the last digit of y is dropped, but the system rounds up the
last digit retained because the dropped digit is 5 or higher (in this
case, 7).

<h2>Sample application: exorcising parasitic users</h2>

<p>Apart from the obvious numerical applications, the BigNumber
package can be useful if your computer is taken over by a hostile,
parasitic, pure-energy life form capable of transferring itself
between human and computer hosts.  A quick survey of the literature
will reveal that the best tactic against this type of infection is to
command the computer to calculate a transcendental number (<i>pi</i>, for
example) to the last digit.  Computers are unable to comprehend the
concept of irrational numbers, since they are so very rational, so
such a calculation so preoccupies the computer that the unwanted life
form is unable to get any CPU time and eventually flees the computer
in frustration.

<p>While BigNumber doesn't provide a dedicated syntax for computing
transcendental numbers "to the last digit," you can still consume
copious amounts of CPU time by asking it to compute a value to a large
finite number of digits, such as

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = BigNumber.getPi(512);
</pre></div>

<p>This will consume about twenty minutes on a Pentium III at 400 MHz.
(It only takes about 90 seconds on a Pentium D at 3.2 GHz, though, so
you might have to increase the number of digits on a fast machine.)
If the parasitic entity is especially tenacious, or tries to shut down
life support, it might be necessary to go out to a thousand or so
digits.

<p>Note that this technique isn't effective against conventional
computer viruses, so users might want to try one of the popular
anti-virus software packages before attempting this solution.
