<h1>Automatic Garbage Collection and Finalization</h1>

<p>In languages like C and C++, the program is required to manage the
object "lifecycle," from allocating memory for objects to deleting
them when they're no longer needed.  TADS 3 lets you create objects
dynamically, but eliminates the need for you to manage their memory
after that point by introducing automatic "garbage collection."

<p>The T3 VM automatically keeps track of which objects can still be
used and which have become inaccessible, and from time to time deletes
the inaccessible objects, making the memory they were using available
for re-use.  (We refer to inaccessible objects as "garbage," because
they're just taking up memory without being of any further use to the
program; and we refer to the process of recognizing and deleting these
inaccessible objects as "garbage collection.")

<p>For the most part, the garbage collector is invisible, so you can
ignore it when writing your program.  However, in some cases you might
wish to be notified when the garbage collector is about to delete one
of your objects.  When you want such notification, you can use a
"finalizer."

<p>A finalizer is a special method, whose name is always
<span class="code">finalize()</span>; this method takes no arguments.  When the garbage
collector determines that an object has become unreachable, it checks
to see if the object has a <span class="code">finalize()</span> method.  If the object does
not have a <span class="code">finalize()</span> method, the garbage collector can simply
delete the object at any subsequent time.  If the object does have a
<span class="code">finalize()</span> method, the garbage collector marks the object as
"finalizable."  Once an object is marked finalizable, the garbage
collector can call the object's <span class="code">finalize()</span> method at any
subsequent time.  Once this method returns, the garbage collector
marks the object as "finalized."  Once the object is marked as
finalized, the garbage collector re-considers the object's
reachability; at any subsequent time that the garbage collector
determines that the object is unreachable, the collector can delete
the object.

<p>Note that the garbage collector must determine that an object with
a <span class="code">finalize()</span> method is unreachable twice before it can actually
delete the object: the object must become unreachable once before the
<span class="code">finalize()</span> method can be called, and then must either remain
unreachable or once again become unreachable before it can be deleted.
The reason for the second reachability check is that the
<span class="code">finalize()</span> method could potentially make the object reachable
again.  Consider this example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
MyGlobals: object
  finalizedList = []
;

class MyClass: object
  finalize()
  {
    MyGlobals.finalizedList += self;
  }
;
</pre></div>

<p>When an instance of <span class="code">MyClass</span> becomes unreachable, the garbage
collector will at some point call the instance's <span class="code">finalize()</span>
method, which adds a reference to the instance to
<span class="code">MyGlobals.finalizedList</span>.  Since <span class="code">MyGlobals</span> is a named object,
it's always reachable, hence anything that <span class="code">MyGlobals.finalizedList</span>
refers to is reachable - this means that the instance being finalized
once again becomes reachable.  So, the garbage collector cannot
actually delete this object until the references is removed from
<span class="code">MyGlobals.finalizedList</span>, at which point the instance once again
becomes unreachable (assuming it hasn't been referenced anywhere else
in the meantime).

<p>The garbage collector calls an object's finalizer only once, even
if the object becomes reachable again while it's being finalized.  The
single finalizer call is enforced by the state transitions: an object
is initially unfinalized; after the garbage collector first notices
that it is unreachable it becomes finalizable; after the garbage
collector calls the finalizer the object becomes finalized.  Once an
object is finalized, it is deleted as soon as the collector notices
that the object is unreachable.  The garbage collector can only call
the finalizer on a finalizable object, and once the finalizer is
called the object becomes finalized; it cannot return to the
finalizable state from the finalized state.

<p>Note that the garbage collector does not run continuously, but only
at certain times; exactly when the collector will run is
unpredictable, because it depends on what memory operations the
program performs, but it's also not usually important, since the
program can largely ignore the collector's operation.  Because of the
unpredictable timing of garbage collection, the timeline descriptions
above are intentionally a little vague; the only thing that's certain
is the order of events, not their exact timing.  So, an object might
be finalized very quickly after it becomes unreachable, or it might
sit in memory for a long time before the garbage collector gets around
to finalizing the object.

<p>Note also that you can explicitly invoke the garbage collector with
the <span class="code">t3RunGC()</span> function in the <a href='t3vm.htm'>t3vm function
set</a>.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

<p>For those interested in academic details, the T3 VM implementation
in TADS 3 uses a synchronous "tracing" garbage collector.

<p>A tracing collector traverses the entire set of accessible objects,
starting with the "root set."  The root set is the set of objects that
are directly reachable to the program, such as local variables and
static objects defined in the source code.  The garbage collector
marks each root set object as reachable, then marks as reachable each
object to which a root set object refers, then marks as reachable each
object to which those objects refer, and so on.  This process
continues until the collector has marked every object that can be
reached directly or indirectly through references from root set
objects.  Any objects not marked during this tracing process are
unreachable, and hence can be deleted.

<p>The TADS 3 collector is synchronous, which means that the VM must
suspend its other operations to run the garbage collector.  However,
on systems that support background threads, the TADS 3 implementation
can run garbage collection in the background while certain types of
user interface activities, such as reading a command line, are taking
place; these operations have no interaction with the memory manager,
hence they can proceed simultaneously with garbage collection.
(Non-blocking garbage collectors have become rather trendy in recent
programming language systems, but a blocking collector seemed
appropriate for TADS 3.  Non-blocking collectors add considerable
complexity to the entire memory management system, and the experience
of most system designers has been that synchronous collectors usually
have higher overall throughput, perhaps owing to their greater
simplicity.  The primary advantage of non-blocking collectors is that
they tend to spread out their work more evenly in time, making them
more suitable for real-time systems; this didn't seem a strong enough
justification for TADS 3.)
