The scripts were created by using the existing scripts from the generic
Unix port of TADS as a template.  They have been modified in order to
fix portability issues.  So if you see a script that looks like this:

  if test -f "$T3_OUT/$1.log"; then
      :
  else
      foo
  fi

don't bother changing it to:

  if [ ! -f $T3_OUT/$1.log ]; then
    foo
  fi

and sending it to the maintainer.  The second example may look much
better, but it's not portable.  ('!' is not portable, '[' is not
portable... welcome to Unix!)  Of course, it's unlikely that people use
4.3BSD or Solaris 8, but still...
