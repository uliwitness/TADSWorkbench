<p>Creating a new game in Workbench is fairly easy. Simply launch Workbench
(e.g. by double-clicking its item in the Finder). You should immediately get
a new, untitled project window. If you don't get one, simply choose
<i>New Project</i> from the <i>File</i> menu and you should get one.
<p>Project files are divided into four groups:
<ul>
<li><i>Source Files</i> holds all your source code for the game, i.e. the
program you write. These files' names usually have the suffix &quot;.t&quot;.
Below that is the list of <i>Include Folders</i>, which means the folders
where the TADS compiler will look for additional source files that you
#include from your code.
<li>Then come the <i>Libraries</i>, which should include &quot;system.tl&quot;
and &quot;adv3/adv3.tl&quot;. Libraries are pre-fabricated collections of code
that provide functionality without you having to write them. E.g. adv3 provides
all the adventure-specific stuff, like rooms, actors etc.
</ul>
<p>If you haven't done so already, save the project file (I'll use the name
&quot;sample.t3m&quot;). You'll want to put it into a folder of its own, so
you can later put all the source files for the game next to it. Then, let's
create a new source file: Choose <i>New Source File</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu. Save the file with the name you want your game to have (I'll use
&quot;sample.t&quot; for now).
<p>Now you have to add your file to the current project: Choose
<i>Add Current File</i> from the <i>Project</i> menu. The file will be added to
the <i>Source Files</i> group in your project. You can also use the <i>Add
Source File...</i> menu item instead and select an existing file if you don't
have one open.
<p>Return to the text file and enter some TADS source code. I'll use:
<pre>
#include &quot;adv3.h&quot;
#include &quot;tok.h&quot;
#include &quot;en_us.h&quot;

me: Person
    location = livingRoom
;


livingRoom: Room
    name = 'Living Room'
    destName = 'the living room'
    desc = &quot;It's a nice, big room.  A potted plant is the only attempt
            at decoration.  Passages lead north, east, and west.
            To the south, the front door of the house
            leads outside. &quot;
;

main(args)
{
    gPlayerChar = me;
    statusLine.showStatusLine();

    &quot;<title>Sample Game</title>&quot;;
    &quot;Welcome to the Game!\b&quot;;

    runGame(true);
}


mainRestore(args, restoreFile)
{
    local succ;

    &quot;<title>Sample Game</title>&quot;;
    &quot;Restoring saved game...\n&quot;;

    succ = RestoreAction.startupRestore(restoreFile);
    &quot;\b&quot;;

    if (succ)
        runGame(nil);
}
</pre>

<p>Now, choose <i>Build</i> from the <i>Project</i> menu. After a little while,
the compiler will be finished and you will have a new game (in my case,
sample.t3). To run it, simply choose <i>Build and Run</i> instead of
<i>Build</i>.
