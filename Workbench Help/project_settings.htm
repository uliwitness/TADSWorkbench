<p>The Project Settings window lets you specify various options that control
how your game is generated, as well as some miscellanea that let you customize
what command-line users see when opening your project file. To bring it up,
choose <i>Project Settings</i> from the <i>Project</i> menu.
<p>Most people will hardly need to access anything beyond the first page of
the Project Settings window, which contains the compiler options. Here's a
rundown of the options available.
<ul>
<li><b>Add Debugging Symbols</b> Check this option if you want to use the
debugger on your game and you're <i>not</i> using the <i>Build and Debug</i>
menu item to do that.
<li><b>Pre-Init options</b> Pre-initialization is a way to speed up startup
of a game by running some functions after building the game, and saving the
result to the game file. By default, pre-initialization is not done for games
being built for debugging to make it possible to debug pre-initialization
functions.
<li><b>Unchanged Files options</b> Under very rare circumstances, you may
find that the TADS compiler fails to notice changes in certain files. If
that happens, you can either occasionally clean the project, thus forcing
a rebuild and re-link of the game, or you can check these options, which
will always force a rebuild. However, notice that this will considerably
slow down building. Only activate these if you've checked that there's no
better way.
<li><b>Output file name</b> If you want the final game file to have a
different name than the one given to it by default, type it in here.
</ul>

<p>The <i>Comments</i> page of the settings window contains commentary text
that people opening your makefile with a text editor will see (This is how
TADS project files are edited on other platforms where no version of
Workbench exists). Note that at this time, Workbench does not prevent you
from entering nonsense here, thus possibly rendering your project file
unusable. Make sure you only enter lines here that start with a hash sign
(#) or are entirely empty.
<p>Also, make sure the <i>Sources Comment</i> always starts with
"##sources", and that such a comment does not show up in the <i>Top Comment</i>.

<p>The <i>Advanced Options</i> page contains additional compiler options
that you want to have passed to the compiler, and configuration information
that Workbench for Macintosh doesn't use (Those are usually specific to
Windows Workbench). Do not change any of these if you are not 100% sure you
know what you're doing.
