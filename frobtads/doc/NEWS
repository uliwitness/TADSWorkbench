v0.7
====

  - On most POSIX systems, the Tads 3 compiler (t3make) should now be
    able to include resources in the build when -res is used to specify
    a whole directory.  The -recurse option should work also.  (Patch
    was submitted by Ilya V. Goz.)

  - Tads 2 character mapping files are now supported and loaded by the
    interpreter when a game requests them.  Charmap files are
    distributed with some games and the interpreter tries to find them
    in the current directory.  The interpreter changes the current
    directory to the game's directory by default, so if you place the
    mapping files in the game's directory the interpreter should load
    them.  (Patch was submitted by Ilya V. Goz.)

    Note that FrobTADS still has problems with 8-bit character sets,
    since curses deals only with 7-bit characters.  This will hopefully
    be fixed in a feature release.


v0.6
====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.12.


v0.5
====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.11.

  - The compiler was unable to compile sourcefiles that were using a
    non-built-in character set.  For example, a sourcefile beginning
    with #charset "koi8-r" would generate an error message.  This has
    been fixed.

  - The Tads 3 "proto-documentation" has been wiped.  More thourough
    documentation is now available at www.tads.org (it's a 10MB
    download so it has not been included in FrobTADS).


v0.4
====

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.10/3.0.10.

  - Fixed a problem where it was not possible to compile TADS 3 games.
    Some required library files, although included in the package, did
    not get installed at the "make install" step.

  - Fixed a compilation problem with "src/missing.cc" ("unknown
    identifier: wc" and "unknown identifier: dst").  This only occured
    on some systems that lack the wchar C99 functions (like some
    Mac OS X systems).

  - Fixed possible color-curruption problems with old/broken curses
    libraries.


v0.3
====

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.9/3.0.9 (the
    included Tads 2.5.9 version is more up-to-date than the official
    2.5.9 release, but it's not yet 2.5.10).

  - Statusline now looks good even when colors are disabled
    ("--no-colors" option) or not available.

  - Fixed compilation problem on systems that don't support the SIGWINCH
    signal ("unknown identifier: SIGWINCH"), like MS Windows with MinGW
    and/or Dev-C++.

  - Fixed the fix of the compilation problem with the <wchar.h>
    functions (wcslen and wcscpy); this time for good, I hope.

  - Hopefully improved terminal resize handling.


v0.2
====

Thanks to Mike Roberts, FrobTADS now has its own homepage and main
distribution point:

 http://www.tads.org/frobtads.htm

  - Some command line options have been changed (type "frob --help" to
    list them).

  - Scrollback mode can now also be activated with the Escape (ESC) key.
    Fixed some possible problems with the ENTER key not being recognized
    on some systems.

  - White text on white background ("frob -t7 -b7") should work now.

  - Fixed a curses compilation problem (compilation failed with
    something like: "unknown identifier: KEY_RESIZE").

  - Screen resizing (when running in an xterm) has been improved; a
    signal handler does the job now and some code has been improved for
    better resizing.

  - Fixed a compilation problem on systems that lack the wchar.h header
    and/or the wchar functions wcslen and wcscpy.

  - If you don't override the default colors, or use white on black
    (-b0 -t7), *and* your curses/ncurses version supports it, the
    interpreter will use the default colors of your terminal.  This
    makes it possible to use bitmap pictures as background, or make the
    terminal transparent (if your terminal supports this, of course).
    Note that, by default, this won't work for the statusline, as it
    reverses the colors.  If you want to use this feature for the entire
    screen, you'll have to start frob with "frob -g0 -l7".

    This feature can be disabled using the "-o" (or "--no-defcolors")
    option.

  - The Tads 3 documentation (HTML format) is now installed along with
    the compiler ([prefix]/share/frobtads/tads3/doc).

  - Documentation files have been moved into the new "doc" directory.
