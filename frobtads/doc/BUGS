Known bugs.  Don't report them; fix them! :)

  - Currently, the interpreter cannot display characters outside the
    7-bit ASCII range.  This should be fixed soon.

  - When a game has set a timeout for an input, and the terminal the
    interpreter runs in is resized, the timeout will be reset to its
    initial value rather than the remaining time.

  - The "--no-defcolors" option doesn't work with all curses versions.

  - On some systems it is not possible to bundle multi-media resources
    into the image file using the -recurse command line option of
    t3make.  The systems affected are those that lack the <glob.h>
    system header.

  - Currently, there's no way to pass arguments to the main() function
    of a TADS 3 game.  The derised behavior should be something like:

      frob [frob options] gamefile.t3 [T3VM options]

  - An interpreter crash (a segfault for example) is likely to leave the
    terminal in a weird state.  Entering "reset" (even if you can't see
    what you're typing) followed by a "unicode_start" (if applicable for
    your system) should bring the terminal back to normal.

  - Plain-mode (pure stdout output without curses) is not supported.  It
    should be easy to implement, but no one has bothered yet.

  - The package does not compile on SuSE Linux 7.2 (GCC 2.9x) with -ansi
    enabled; works just fine without it.  Looks like a bug in the
    system's header files.

  - Some test suite programs fail to link with GCC 2.x.
