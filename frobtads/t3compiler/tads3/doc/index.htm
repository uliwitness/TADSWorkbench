<b>Getting Started in TADS 3</b>
</a>
by Eric Eve

<p>This tutorial introduction is the best starting point for anyone
new to TADS 3.  This book opens with the basics of getting TADS
working on your system and setting up your first simple game, so even
if you've never done any programming before, this will help you get
going quickly.  The book goes on from there to introduce all of the
essential TADS 3 features.  By the time you're done, you'll know your
way around the system and you'll be able to write your own games.

<p><i>This book is accompanied by a sample game, </i>The Further Adventures
of Heidi<i>.  The game's source files can be found here:</i><tt>

<b>TADS 3 System Manual</b>

<p>This book is a reference to the TADS 3 language and the T3 VM,
including the standard intrinsic functions and classes.  It
covers the language and VM features in depth, so it's the place
to go when you need to find the details on the system.

<b>Introduction to HTML TADS</b>
</a>

<p>TADS 3 uses HTML as its formatting language.  These notes explain
how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML formatting codes for
text effects, graphics, and sound.  (These are the original notes for
HTML TADS 2, so they're a little rough.  We've at least updated them
with relevant changes for TADS 3.  Note that this isn't an HTML
tutorial - but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to standard HTML, so
you can learn it from any of the many tutorials on the Web for
ordinary HTML.)
