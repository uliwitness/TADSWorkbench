Since then, it has grown and developed as a result both of feedback from people who have used it, and of its author's attempts to make it increasingly accessible to those with little or no previous IF programming experience. In its present form it is intended to be used as a starting point for anyone wishing to learn to write Interactive Fiction using TADS 3.</p><p>This guide has never been intended as a complete manual covering every aspect of the language and library; it is instead intended to introduce new users to the basics of the system. If you are new to TADS 3, the best way for you to get to grips with it is probably for you to work through this guide and gain a reasonably secure understanding of its contents before moving on to the other documentation that covers the language and library in more depth. </p><p>A considerable amount of new material has been added to this edition of <i>Getting Started</i>, most of it derived from documentation orginally written by Mike Roberts. Mike's technical article <i>Creating your First TADS 3 Project</i> has been incorporated into Chapter 1. The 'Programming Prolegomena' section of Chapter 1 has been supplemented with a 'Further Programming and Concepts' section (mainly derived from the TADS 2 manual and TADS 3 language documentation) in order to complete the coverage of fundamental programming concepts the novice needs to know. Moreover, Chapter 2 is essentially a TADS 3 version of Chapter 1 of the TADS 2 manual. It is hoped that the inclusion of this additional material will greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the need to consult multiple documents while using this guide to start learning TADS 3.</p><p>Once you are reasonably comfortable with what <i>Getting Started</i> has to teach, however, you will need to move on to other documentation (and practice using the system) to start gaining mastery. The <i>TADS 3 Tour Guide</i> provides a much more thorough overview of the TADS 3 library, and can be used as a tutorial to follow that contained herein. The <i>System Manual</i> describes the TADS 3 language in far more depth than is possible here, and you will find yourself needing to consult it frequently (reading through it at some stage might be no bad idea too, though there'll be parts you'll probably want to skip till you need them), while the <i>TADS 3 Library Reference Manual</i> provides a complete reference to the library. Finally, the <i>Technical Manual</i> covers a number of issues not dealt with in this guide, and goes into far more detail on some that are.</p><p>It remains only to say three things: first to record my appreciation for the enormous amount of effort that Mike Roberts has put into the development of TADS 3, and for his comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this guide; second to record my thanks for his permission to incorporate parts of his own work into this guide; and finally to thank all those readers of previous versions of this guide for their feedback and suggestions, which will hopefully enhance its usefulness for those that follow.</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr valign="TOP"><td width="51"></td><td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;<br></font></td></tr></table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr valign="TOP"><td width="51"></td><td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="3" color="#000000"></font></td></tr></table><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="3" color="#000000"><p align="RIGHT"><i>Eric Eve<br>Harris Manchester College<br>Oxford<br>July 2007<br></i></p></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif" size="2" color="#000000"><br></font></font><HR><P><FONT SIZE=-1><I>Getting Started in TADS 3</I><BR><a href="index.html">[Main]</a><BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="generalintroduction.htm">[Next] </a></I></FONT></P></body></html>
