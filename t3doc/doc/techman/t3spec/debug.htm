<h2>T3 Debug Records</h2>

<p>
This section describes the debugger information records that a compiler
can optionally store in an image file.  Debug records are not needed for
normal execution of a program; they're required only for interactive
source-level debugging.

<p>
Normally, a compiler will provide a compile-time option to
include or suppress debug information in an image file.  This setting
is usually global to the entire image, but a compiler could include
debug information on a method-by-method basis.  The user would use
this compiler setting to include debug information during the
development process, but not include any debug records when 
compiling the final image file for release.


<h3>Method Debug Records</h3>

<p>
Each method can have an associated debug record, which specifies
information local to the method:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Local variable and parameter names
<li>Source file locations corresponding to byte-code instructions
<li>Local variables in scope at particular byte-code instructions
</ul>

<p>If a method has a debug record, the debugger records field in
the <a href='model.htm#methods'>method header</a> must give the
non-zero offset of the record.  If the method has no debugger
records, this field must be set to zero.

<p>
The format of the debug table is as follows:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Debug table header
<tr><td>UINT2 number of line records
<tr><td>Line record 1
<tr><td>Line record 2
<tr><td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
<tr><td>Line record N
<tr><td>UINT2 offset (from here) to first byte after end of frame table
<tr><td>UINT2 number of frames
<tr><td>UINT2 offset (from here) to frame entry 1
<tr><td>UINT2 offset (from here) to frame entry 2
<tr><td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
<tr><td>UINT2 offset (from here) to frame entry N
<tr><td>Frame 1
<tr><td>Frame 2
<tr><td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
<tr><td>Frame N
<tr><td>UINT4 0 (constant zero value)
</table>

<p>Note that the size of the debug table header is given by the 
"debug table header size" field from the <a href='format.htm#BlockENTP'>
ENTP block</a> in the image file; this information is parameterized
in the image file to allow for changes to be made in future versions
without affecting compatibility.

<p>All of the offsets listed as "from here" are relative to the first
byte of the entry itself.  For example, consider the first offset,
which gives the offset to the first byte after the frame table.
Suppose that the frame table has no entries at all, in which case the
frame table only requires two bytes, specifically the UINT2 giving
the number of entries, which in this case would be set to zero.  So,
the offset to the end of the frame table would have the value 4: two
bytes for the space occupied by this offset entry itself, and another
two bytes for the frame count field that follows.

<p>The final UINT4 zero value is a placeholder for future expansion;
if additional fields are added in future specifications, this field
will have a non-zero value to indicate the presence of additional
information.  Setting this field to zero will ensure that debug tables
produced under this specification will remain compatible with future
interpreters.

<p>The debug table header has the following structure:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td><i>This table is currently empty</i>
</table>

<p>
Each line record gives information on a single executable
statement in the source code; what constitutes a single executable
statement is up to the compiler to determine (this is well-defined
concept in most programming languages).  Each line entry specifies
an association with a contiguous range of byte-code instructions,
a source file location, and a frame entry within the same debug
records table.

<p>
Line records must appear in the table in ascending order of byte-code
offsets.  Each record specifies only its starting offset, but a given
line record implicitly references all of the instructions starting
at its starting offset and continuing to the byte before the
starting offset of the following line record.

<p>Each line record is arranged like this:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>UINT2 offset (from method start) of first byte-code instruction
associated with this line of source code
<tr><td>UINT2 source file index, a zero-based index into the global
source file list
<tr><td>UINT4 source file line number
<tr><td>UINT2 frame ID, a one-based index into the method's frame list
(a value of zero indicates that there is no local scope for the line).
This is the innermost scope with which the line is associated; the
frame itself contains links to any enclosing scopes.
</table>

<p>
Each frame table entry provides a local symbol table.  Frames can
be nested, with the innermost frame taking precedence in the case of
any name collisions with enclosing frames.

<p>Frame records are of varying size (which is why the index of
frame record pointers appears in the debug record
before the frames themselves), and are arranged like this:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>UINT2 ID of enclosing frame, a one-based index into the method's
frame list (a value of zero indicates that this is the outermost frame)
<tr><td>UINT2 number of entries in the symbol table
<tr><td>Entry 1
<tr><td>Entry 2
<tr><td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
<tr><td>Entry N
</table>

<p>
Each entry in the frame gives information on a single local variable.
These entries are of varying size, and are arranged like this:

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Local Symbol Header
<tr><td>UINT2 length in bytes of symbol name
<tr><td>symbol name as a UTF-8 string
</table>

<p> The symbol header is arranged as follows.  Note that the record
might contain additional entries in future versions; when parsing
these records, debuggers and other tools should always use the "debug
local symbol header size" from the <a href='format.htm#BlockENTP'>
entrypoint (ENTP) record</a> in the image file to determine the
record's actual size.

<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>UINT2 local variable or parameter number, with the same meaning as
the variable number in a GETLCL or GETARG instruction
<tr><td>UINT2 flags
<tr><td>UINT2 context local index.  This is used
only if (flags &amp; 2) is non-zero (i.e., the context local flag bit
is set).
</table>

<p>
The "flags" entry is a bitwise "OR" combination of the following
values:

<ul>
<li>1: the symbol is a parameter (argument) variable.  If this flag is
not set, the symbol is a local, not a parameter.

<li>2: the symbol is a "context local" variable.  The "local variable
number" field in the record is still a stack location, but this stack
location does not contain the variable's value, but merely the
context array object which contains the variable's value.  The
"context array index" field gives the index in the context array
containing the variable's value.  If this bit is not set, the symbol
is an ordinary stack variable.  Note that if this flag is set, the
parameter flag should be ignored.

</ul>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> All bits not specified above are reserved for future
designation, so the flags entry should be taken as a bit mask.
To ensure compatibility with future specifications, compilers should
set all bits not specified here to zero, and interpreters should ignore
all bits not specified here.

<p> A "context local" is a local variable stored not in the stack but
in a separate context array object.  The reference to the context
object is reachable through the local variable given in the record,
and the symbol's actual value is stored in the array at the index
given by the context array index in the record.  So, to retrieve a
context variable, the equivalent of the following VM instructions can
be executed:

<p>
<pre>
    GETLCL <i>local variable number from record</i>
    PUSHINT4 <i>context array index from record</i>
    INDEX
</pre>
