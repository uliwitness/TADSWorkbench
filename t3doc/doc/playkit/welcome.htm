Welcome!
<td>

<p>
Thanks for installing the HTML TADS Player Kit!  This kit has
everything you need to play games created for TADS 3, including
HTML TADS 3 games.

<p>TADS stands for the Text Adventure Development System; it's a
programming system for creating interactive fiction games.  HTML TADS
is an enhanced version that provides graphics, sound, and powerful
text formatting capabilities.

How to Play a TADS Game
<td>

<p>To play a TADS game, you don't need to know anything about TADS,
HTML, or programming.  All you need is this Player Kit, plus the
game that you want to play.  To run a TADS game, select "HTML TADS
Interpreter" from the "TADS" group on your Windows "Start" menu;
the interpreter will then ask you to select a game to play.

Where to Find TADS Games
<td>

<p><a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/">IFDB</a>, the Interactive Fiction
Database, has listings for thousands of IF games, with descriptions,
reviews, recommendations, and download links.  There you can find most
TADS games that have ever been released, along with games for other IF
authoring systems.

<p>The definitive place to look for anything related to Interactive
Fiction is the <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>.
The Archive has the internet's most extensive public collection of
Interactive Fiction downloads, including games, articles, and
programming systems.  Numerous games written with TADS can be found on
the Archive in the directory <a
href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXtads.html">
if-archive/games/tads/</a>.

<p>Note that this version of the Player Kit only works with games
written with TADS 3 - older games written with TADS 2 require the TADS
2+3 Player Kit.  For this reason, we no longer distribute this TADS
3-only version.  We recommend uninstalling this version and getting
the full TADS 2+3 Player Kit instead - it's available for free from
the IF Archive or <a href="http://www.tads.org/">tads.org</a>.
