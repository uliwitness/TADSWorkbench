TADS Player Kit
</div>
<div class=sec>

<b>Now that you've installed the Author's Kit, you should
<i>also</i> install the HTML TADS Player Kit.</b> The Player Kit
includes the full version of the TADS Interpreter - it can run games
written with TADS 3 as well as those created with TADS 2, and it
features the TADS Game Chest, which helps you organize the games
you've downloaded.  This Author's Kit includes only a simplified
version of the interpreter that's designed primarily for building
stand-alone games, so you'll want the full Player Kit version if
you're planning to play any TADS games.

<p>You can find the Player Kit in the IF-Archive's
<a href='http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogrammingXtads3Xexecutables.html'>
programming/tads3/executables</a> directory.

notes in particular if:

<ul>
  <li>HTML TADS is crashing;
  <li>you're using a Linux system running Wine;
  <li>you're using a non-English version of Windows.

The TADS 3 documentation is organized into several manuals, which
you can find via the <a href="../../doc/index.htm">User's Manuals</a>
page.

<p>If you're new to TADS, there are two introductory books to choose
from.  <i>Getting Started in TADS 3</i> is a tutorial designed for
beginners, especially those without prior programming experience.
<i>Learning TADS 3</i> is written for confident newcomers and those
with a little programming experience.  Both books are by Eric Eve, and
you can find them on the <a href="../../doc/index.htm">User's
Manuals</a> page.


<p>The Usenet newsgroup <a href='news:rec.arts.int-fiction'>
rec.arts.int-fiction</a> is dedicated to discussion of the art and
science of creating interactive fiction.  The newsgroup is frequented
by several TADS experts, including the system's author, and technical
questions about TADS are usually answered quickly.  The newsgroup is
an excellent resource and community for everyone interested in
creating interactive fiction, from beginners to experienced game
authors.
